/* ******************************************************************
   Go Back N protocol.  Adapted from J.F.Kurose
   ALTERNATING BIT AND GO-BACK-N NETWORK EMULATOR: VERSION 1.2

   Network properties:
   - one way network delay averages five time units (longer if there
   are other messages in the channel for GBN), but can be larger
   - packets can be corrupted (either the header or the data portion)
   or lost, according to user-defined probabilities
   - packets will be delivered in the order in which they were sent
   (although some can be lost).

   Modifications:
   - removed bidirectional GBN code and other code not used by prac.
   - fixed C style to adhere to current programming style
   - added GBN implementation
